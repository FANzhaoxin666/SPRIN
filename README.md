# PRIN/SPRIN: On Extracting Point-wise Rotation Invariant Features

## Overview
This repository is the Pytorch implementation of [PRIN/SPRIN: On Extracting Point-wise Rotation Invariant Features](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.12093.pdf), which is an improved version of [our previous work](https://github.com/qq456cvb/PRIN).

## ShapeNet Part Segmentation results

## Feature Matching Results for PRIN

## Dependencies
* [hydra](https://hydra.cc/) is required for configuration.

## Dataset and pretrained weights
* Download ShapeNet part segmentation dataset from https://shapenet.cs.stanford.edu/media/â€‹shapenet_part_seg_hdf5_data.zip
* Pretrained weights for SPRIN can be downloaded from
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZwN0bJ3UgCJheqYcUrEZyHIH8tEgk3cR/view?usp=sharing
## Train/Test
Once the dataset is placed under the root directory, just run
```
python sprin/train.py
```
for training, and 
```
python sprin/train.py
```
for testing.

## TODOs
[ ] Code for improved PRIN and ModelNet40 classification.
